#  Files:
- **Yelp_Dataset.ipynb** - Created to help members know how to import the dataset and load it correctly. Also created code to clean up the dataset by removing certain columns from specific datasets (e.g. business and user datasets). This file is used since importing the actual cleaned datasets to GitHub is not possible, considering each dataset is considerably large. 
- **Predictive_Modeling.ipynb** - Created to implement baseline models, with the goal to predict business star rating using simple features by implementing linear regression and decision tree.
